#State Estimation of a Two-Wheeled Car
This is the webpage for Team Velma's submission for lab 4 of EE183DA Winter 2017, taught by Professor Ankur Mehta.
##Introduction
In this lab, we consider a small, two-wheeled car controlled by a microcontroller.  A sample car fitting this description is shown in figure 1.<br>

This car is driven by two continuous servos, one for each wheel.  Each servo is driven by a pulse-width modulation (PWM) input from the on-board microcontroller.  When the servos are driven, the state of the vehicle, consisting of the x,y coordinate relative to some origin of the car, its rotation relative to some axis, and the time derivatives of those three values, changes.  Our goal in this lab is to be able to measure the state of the vehicle as accurately as possible given the inputs sent to the servos as well as noisy sensor data that provides a partial understanding of the vehicle state.
##Simulation
Rather than physically construct this small, two-wheeled car, our team chose to simulate its operation.  This simulation operates simply at a high level: receive PWM inputs, add some noise to these inputs, use the noisy PWM inputs to generate the actual RPM and direction of each servo, and lastly model the sensing of the RPM/direction data.  
###Sensing
The original lab specification provides for IR sensors attached to each servo that produce a HIGH/LOW signal based on the position of the wheel, which had twenty alternating white/black colored circular sectors.  We found that this was not an ideal sensing solution for state estimation; a discussion on this is included later in this report.<br>
Instead of the IR sensor, our group decided to simulate the use of a rotary encoder.  A rotary encoder provides a measure of both the RPM of the shaft it is attached to (after some simple processing) as well as the direction of shaft rotation.  The rotary encoder we chose to simulate can measure 2500 pulses per revolution, meaning that it can measure to the nearest .0004 of a rotation of the attached shaft.  We chose to simulate the presence of a rotary encoder on each servo output shaft, giving us an RPM for each wheel.
###PWM Inputs
The two servos on the vehicle take in a PWM signal and then process the input signal into rotational motion.  We consider the PWM frequency of our system to be 500Hz, meaning that each PWM period is exactly 2ms.  Per the data sheet of the continuous servo used, within the context of 500Hz PWM we can say that a 2ms pulse width is equal to full-speed counterclockwise rotation of the servo, a 1.5ms pulse width (along with a small deadband around 1.5ms) is equal to no change in the rotation of the servo and that a 1ms pulse width is equal to full-speed clockwise rotation of the servo.<br>
During operation of the vehicle, we assume that the user will only send signals with widths of 1ms, 1.5ms or 2ms (this assumption is elaborated later on).  Due to both limitations of the microcontroller sending the PWM signal, limitations of the servo and loss on the wire, we assume that the final interpreted PWM signal will never be exactly 1ms, 1.5ms or 2ms.  Instead, we model that for each input width there is a range of values which the final interpreted PWM signal will fall on:<br>
+ 1ms: final value will lie between 1ms and 1.1ms 
+ 1.5ms: final value will lie between 1.49ms and 1.51ms
+ 2ms: final value will lie between 1.9ms and 2ms  
Note that for 1.5ms, the final interpreted value is much closer to the actual input than for the other options.  This is due to the consideration of the deadband around 1.5ms input which ensures that at values close to 1.5ms there is no motion; we consider this deadband by putting it entirely at 1.5ms and moving up the values that would have been immediately on each side of the deadband to be adjacent to 1.5ms.  For both 1ms and 2ms, it is possible that the signal could be less than 1ms or greater than 2ms; however, we consider any pulse width reasonably close to but lower than 1ms to be equivalent to 1ms and pulse widths greater than 2ms will simply blend into the next PWM period.  
###Generation of RPM
Through some testing with a sample load and the rotary encoder, we determined that the max RPM achieved at both 1ms and 2ms was roughly 65RPM.
